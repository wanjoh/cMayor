The idea of this project is that every average citizen can make their initiative and contribute to the city. If a lot of people like new initiative, apropos if they support it via online voting, it can actually realize. Let's say the number of online votes to realize some initiative is 10 thousand. If it reaches that, it becomes voted. With the help of this Android app which is simple to use, anyone can make it, but that doesn't mean each will be approved or voted. When a new one is created, it first comes to our “safety check” where 3 moderators need to approve that initiative so it can come in part of online voting. There is only one condition that needs to be fulfilled to use this app - user must be logged in to his own account. Making of account is simple and from private information, it requires users' first and last name, email address and place of residence(to simplify usage).
