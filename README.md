# cMayor
The idea of this project is that average citizen can make their own initiative and contribute to the city. If a lot of people like the new initiative and they support it via online voting, it can actually come to realization. Let's say the number of online votes to realize some initiative is 10 000. If it reaches that, it becomes voted. With the help of this Android app which is simple to use, anyone can make it (but that doesn't mean each will be approved or voted). When a new one is created, it first comes to our “safety check” where 3 moderators need to approve that initiative so it can come to next phase, which is online voting. There is only one condition that needs to be fulfilled to use this app - user must be logged in to his own account.
